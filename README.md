 A repo of all challenges and projects from the Codelabs "Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers"
  
## Purpose

 The purpose of this repo is to display and congregate all the work I have done and will do in the Kotlin Bootcamp. This will one of several in a series that should help me learn new skills as well as create content that I can display as a token effort. I will be writing notes in this README.md while also taking more extensive notes by hand in the red CMSC 355 notebook.
